	  <h1>ElWhip: Featuring lwIP - A Lightweight TCP/IP Stack</h1>
	  <p>
	    The web page you are viewing is being served on an original 
		Macintosh with 512K RAM. This is the first known TCP/IP stack 
		running on a Macintosh with the original 64K ROMs. This is made
		possible by the lightweight TCP/IP stack <a
	    href="http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/">lwIP</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    lwIP is an open source implementation of the TCP/IP
	    protocol suite that was originally written by <a
	    href="http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/">Adam Dunkels
	    of the Swedish Institute of Computer Science</a> but now is
	    being actively developed by a team of developers
	    distributed world-wide. Since it's release, lwIP has
	    spurred a lot of interest and has been ported to several
	    platforms and operating systems. lwIP can be used either
	    with or without an underlying OS.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce
	    the RAM usage while still having a full scale TCP. This
	    makes lwIP suitable for use in embedded systems with tens
	    of kilobytes of free RAM and room for around 40 kilobytes
	    of code ROM.
	  </p>

	    homepage at <a
